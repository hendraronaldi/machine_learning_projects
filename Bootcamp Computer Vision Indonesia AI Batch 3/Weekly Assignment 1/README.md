## Project Overview
The Real Estate industry in Indonesia is experiencing rapid growth, especially in urban areas, with residential and commercial projects continuing to develop.

A system capable of determining house prices is crucial in the Real Estate industry as it assists sellers, buyers, and investors in making more informed and accurate decisions, avoiding overpricing or underpricing, and improving market efficiency.

## Dataset
It's a regression problem with dataset [AMES Housing Data](./dataset/) used in this project. 

## Experiment Results
Detailed Notebook for this project can be found [here]([Notebook](./CVB_Bootcamp_IndonesiaForAI_Weekly_Assignment_1.ipynb))

Using grid search cross validation to optimize result on random forest model, here is the result on validation dataset
1. Full feature: `RMSE = 27658.04`. This means for dataset price in range `10,000` to `40,000` there will be error `Â±27658.04`
